# pi-node-cluster

These are my notes to build a JavaScript tech cluster using 3 raspberry pis.

The goals is to learn about multi server, different tech used such as Ansible, Docker, nginx, mongodb, node, networking, security, performance, monitoring... 

Questions I have:
1. how to organize user management?
2. could I pull this off using only vim?
3. How to work with docker?
4. How to monitor these systems?
5. How to benchmark, and against what?
6. How can I do this as secure as possible?
